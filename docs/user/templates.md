# Templates

All forms in the user module are rendered using [Angular2 Schema Form](https://github.com/dschnelldavis/angular2-json-schema-form)
It supports rendering for several css frameworks.

Authumn Angular supports the following frameworks:
 - bootstrap-3
 - material-design 
 
In order to support a good and decent out-of-the-box experience for Authumn Angular,
there are standard components available for registration/login etc.

While the ways of displaying login and registration fields are versatile.

Some common components can be identified:

 - login form
 - registration form
 - social buttons
 
In general you will not use this element directly but always
embed them within a custom form or one of the prefab templates available.

### Login Form

The bare login form element is defined as:

`<authumn-login></authumn-login>`

### Registration Form

The bare registration form element is defined as:

`<authumn-registration></authumn-registration>`
